#Giffaw

Your goal is to integrate with the Giphy API.

Use the Giphy API documentation at https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI

Requirements:

* A user can see the top 25 trending gifs when the page loads
* A user can search for gifs, using the input field
* Bonus: A user can "load more" gifs

Your site should look something like:

![desktop layout](/layout_goal.png)


Workflow & Submission:
* Fork this repository.
* Clone the `giffaw` repo from *your* gitHub account onto your computer.
* Open `index.html` in your browser to see the current version of our site.
* Make changes to (at least) `base.js` to complete the lab goals.
* `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
* `git push` to update the repo on your gitHub account.
* Submit the link to the `giffaw` repo on your gitHub account.

Hint(s):
* Try thinking of the exercise in two parts: (1) displaying the mock data from `mock_data.js` and (2) using the actual data from the Giphy API.
